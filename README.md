# AI Quality Assurance - Real-Time Defect Detection System

This project is built for **Cyfuture Hackathon 1.0 ‚Äì Challenge 3: Quality Assurance with AI**, focused on real-time defect detection in manufacturing using computer vision.

---

## üöÄ Overview

An end-to-end AI-powered quality assurance system that:

* Detects visual defects in manufacturing (bottle caps/necks) using autoencoders
* Works in real-time using webcam or uploaded images
* Generates reports and QR codes for traceability
* Visualizes reconstructions and anomaly maps for insights

---

## üß† Core Features

* üîç **Real-time Anomaly Detection** (autoencoder + MSE)
* üì∑ **Camera & Image Upload Support**
* üìà **Live Confidence Scoring**
* üßæ **Automated Report Generation**
* üì¶ **Unique QR Code for Traceability**
* üßä **Freeze-Frame Analysis + Redo Button**
* üìä **Defect Visualization: Original vs Reconstructed**

```

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. Flask backend receives image via upload or webcam frame.
2. The image is preprocessed (resized, normalized).
3. Autoencoder reconstructs it; MSE is calculated.
4. Threshold is applied to determine defect.
5. UI updates results, visualizations, and allows QR/report generation.

## üìå Limitations & Next Steps

* Current model works well with MVTec dataset
* Real-world webcam accuracy may vary (needs fine-tuning or retraining)
* Real-time prediction is enhanced with freeze-frame + manual re-detect
* Future improvement: YOLO-based cap detection, cloud traceability
